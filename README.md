The 4-7-8 Breathing Visualizer is based on an ancient yogic method called Pranayama. It involves a specific pattern of breath regulation known as the 4-7-8 technique, which is also referred to as the "Navy SEAL technique" or the Military Sleep method. This technique helps practitioners focus on their breathing rather than the worries that keep them awake at night.
